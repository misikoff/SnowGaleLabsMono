{/* ## Overview

Inspired by Milo of Croton, who carried a calf every day until it became a bull, Toron is a strength training app that helps you track progressive overload and build muscle. It embodies the spirit of the ancient Greeks, who believed in the power of consistency and discipline, as well as the beauty of form.

    •	Data Freedom: Export your workouts—your data, your control.

    •	1 Simple Subscription: Get all features free for 15 workouts, then subscribe monthly for unlimited workout history.
